# Atem Keyboard

A simple application to allow for remapping the full keyboard to control a Blackmagic ATEM switcher.


## Usage

After building the project, rename config.json.example to config.json and edit it to setup the keymap.

The Config.cs file shows the available configuration options, and should help in configuring.

Note: The window opened by this program must be in focus for it to receive and handle any key presses.
